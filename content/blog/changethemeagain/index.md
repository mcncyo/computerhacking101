I've decided to switch the theme of my website once again, this time to one that offers more features like copy and paste, as well as a functioning search feature. In order to simplify the deployment process, I've configured my Jenkins site to create a docker container using nginx to host the website. However, I'm still working on automating the deployment process for new pages, as I currently have to manually redeploy it through Portainer and clear the cache on Cloudflare.

This website has been keeping me busy, but I'm still working on creating Youtube videos. Once I've ironed out some of the remaining bugs on the website, I'll be able to focus more on making new videos.
