I have modified the appearance of this website and am currently in the process of refining some of its pages, such as the contact page, while also incorporating a new copy-and-paste feature for ease of code sharing. Please note that further changes to the website's aesthetics may occur.

In addition, I am diligently working on the completion of a tutorial video regarding the utilization of syncthing, which will likely be accompanied by supplementary documentation on this platform.

Moreover, I am in the process of finalizing a video detailing my experience with transferring to a 1u case. I am eager for you to witness this video and learn from any potential errors I may have made.
